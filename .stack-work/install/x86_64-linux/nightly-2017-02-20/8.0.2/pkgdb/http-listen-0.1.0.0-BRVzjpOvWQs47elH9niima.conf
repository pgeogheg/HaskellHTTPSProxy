synopsis: Listen to HTTP requests and handle them in arbitrary ways.
description:
    In HTTP connections, there is a client side which sends requests (such as GET
    and POST), and a server side which receives and parses them. Often, the
    server side is a web server which responds to requests by sending some HTML
    pages back. But sometimes it's just a listener.
    .
    For example, a Git server may offer web hooks. It could send a POST request
    whenever a commit is made, or a new repository is created. You then set up a
    program that listens to these POSTs and reacts by reporting them to the
    project's IRC channel or a mailing list.
    .
    Most HTTP packages assume a typical web server which handles requests by
    returning HTTP responses. This package tries to fill a gap by providing an
    API for simple listeners which don't necessarily serve web pages, and can do
    things like reporting to IRC.
    .
    Some features are missing and will be added soon:
    .
    * Connection timeouts
    .
    * Logging (currently errors are written to stdout, no other logging done)
